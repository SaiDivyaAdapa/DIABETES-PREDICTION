Our  objective is to predict whether user is diabetes positive or not based on various features like Glucose level, insulin level, blood pressure, BMI(Body Mass Index), etc.,.
We perform all steps from the Data collection to model deployment. We compare various machine learning algorithms during model evaluation based on evaluation metrics like accuracy, F1_score, recall, etc.,. Then we create web application using ReactJS, Python Flask and SQLite Database. 
We selected algorithm with the highest accuracy and converted that model into a joblib file, which can be implemented in a user interface for prediction purposes. The trained Random Forest model, after saving as a joblib file, which seamlessly integrated into the Python Flask at backend. When the backend receives input data from the front end, it passes this data to the model for prediction.
